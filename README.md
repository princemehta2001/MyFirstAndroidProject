# MyFirstAndroidProject
It is my first assignment for android development. The main purpose of this app is to convert km to miles and vice-versa. 
It can handle wrong input format like alphabtes or empty strings.

For full source code I have uploaded ConvertMilesToKm.zip file.

If you want to download my application on your android phone then you can access ConvertMilesToKmApp.apk. It is 100% safe and built by me only.
